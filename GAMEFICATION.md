# 📚 Rose Expense Tracker - Intelligent SMS Learning System Documentation

## 🎯 Overview

The Rose Expense Tracker implements an **intelligent SMS learning system** that automatically categorizes financial transactions by learning from user behavior. Instead of relying on hardcoded patterns, the system dynamically generates and evolves patterns based on user interactions, creating a personalized and adaptive expense tracking experience.

## 🧠 Core Concept

The system treats SMS categorization as a **machine learning problem with human-in-the-loop training**. Users teach the app by categorizing sample transactions, and the app learns to automatically categorize similar transactions in the future.

## 🧠 How the Learning Works

### Dynamic Pattern Generation
The patterns are **dynamically generated** based on user behavior and SMS content. This is what makes the system truly intelligent and adaptive.

#### Pattern Discovery Process
1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract key features from SMS
2. **Grouping**: Group similar transactions by category
3. **Pattern Finding**: Find common patterns within groups
4. **Rule Generation**: Create rules based on patterns
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate confidence based on examples

#### Real Example of Learning
**Training Phase:**
1. User sees: "Rs.250 debited from A/c XX1234 at SWIGGY"
2. User categorizes: Transaction Type: "Online", Category: "Food & Dining"
3. App learns: "SWIGGY" + "debited at" = "Online Food & Dining"

**Application Phase:**
1. New SMS: "Rs.180 debited from A/c XX5678 at ZOMATO"
2. App thinks: "ZOMATO" is similar to "SWIGGY", "debited at" pattern matches
3. App suggests: "Online Food & Dining" with 85% confidence
4. User confirms, app learns: "ZOMATO" = "Food & Dining"

**Advanced Learning:**
1. After 10 food transactions, app learns: "debited at [FOOD_MERCHANT]" = "Food & Dining"
2. App can now categorize new food merchants automatically
3. Confidence increases as more examples are learned

This creates a **self-improving system** that gets smarter with each user interaction! 🚀
